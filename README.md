# Myflix

This is a single page web application created in Angular. It uses TD-forms (template driven) and allows the user subscribe to an online movie website to stream content. The user can subscribe to a plan and view videos in the gallery, or login without a plan and view movie trailers only. The data is stored in a mongoDB backend database. I also created a backend restful apis application using Node.js and deployed the project to Heroku. This Angular application uses the apis from the Node.js restful apis application. That project can also be found on gitHub - https://github.com/mcflav/myflix-backend.
Currently this project needs to be ran locally from a machine with Node.js(npm) installed. To run locally follow the below steps:
•	download the project into a folder on your local machine.
•	launch a command prompt and browse to the folder the project is in.
•	issue the following command to update the project on your local machine: npm install
•	issue the following command to execute the website: ng serve
•	Open a web browser and enter the following url: http://localhost:4200/.
•	This will take you to the home page of the web application.
