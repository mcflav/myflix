# myflix
This is a sigle page video streaming website created in Angular. It uses TD-forms (template driven) and allows the user to subscribe to the video streaming website product. Thus far the site works for users registering, logging in, and subscribing to a streaming plan. The producers setup and system administrator pages are still being worked on and are not complete. The data is stored in a mongoDB backend database. I also created the backend database using Node.js and deployed the project to Heroku using a MongoDB database. That project can also be found on gitHub - https://github.com/mcflav/myflix-backend.
